# ✨ Recognition of South Indian Handwritten Text Using Deep Learning ✨

## 🚀 Project Overview
Ever wondered how to transcribe handwritten South Indian languages like Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam into digital text? This project leverages deep learning to achieve that. Developed as my final year project, it showcases the cutting-edge technology and innovation in the field of handwritten text recognition.

## 🧠 The Brainy Bits
Our model uses a **two-tiered approach**:
1. **Tier 1:** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifies the language.
2. **Tier 2:** A CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) coupled with BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) models transcribe the text for the identified language using CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) loss for alignment.

This ensures super accurate recognition and conversion of handwritten text into a digital format.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, Gradio for UI
- **Languages:** Python
- **Tools:** High-performance GPUs, PyTest for unit testing, Google Colab for running the model, Google Drive for model storage

## 📊 Key Features
- Recognizes and transcribes handwritten text in **Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam**
- Utilizes **CNNs** for language classification and **CRNN-BiLSTM** models for transcription
- CTC loss function to align predicted sequences with ground truth
- Enhances accuracy and efficiency, saving tons of time and resources
- UI built using **Gradio**, making it user-friendly and interactive

## 🎨 Project Highlights
- Robust dataset creation with diverse handwriting styles
- High accuracy and efficiency in transcribing handwritten text
- Preprocessing steps like resizing, normalization, and noise removal for optimal recognition
- Leveraged **IIIT Hyderabad's INDIC Handwritten Words Dataset** for training

## 🌟 Why This Project Rocks
This project addresses the gap in existing solutions, offering a robust, efficient, and accurate system for recognizing South Indian handwritten scripts. Perfect for anyone tired of manually transcribing text!

## 📅 Timeline & Development
Developed as part of my final year project at CMR Institute of Technology, Bengaluru.
